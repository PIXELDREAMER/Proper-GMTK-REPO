Hello!

To use the assets from the prototype I've made you need to:

1. Dowload the "assets" zip file and extract it, that will extract the folder onto the dowloads folder of your device.

2. Add it either inside the folder 'assets' in your Unity Project if you have a existing one (remember to rename this dowloadeded assets folder before adding it into Unity as otherwise it's gonna mix the files of my assets folder with yours which could make a mess) or if you have a blank project you can just replace your assets folder with mine (but beware that this could theorically cause issues but you are probably fine).

Tip: A shortcut to acess the files of your unity project is to press the right button of your mouse in the project window and select the option 'show in explorer' which is at the top most of the options right under create.

If you have any problems tell me in discord, I've tested and I did these steps and it all worked inside both a blank project and a existing one!
